# Automated-Systems-Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of five automated systems using TinkerCAD Circuits and Arduino. Each task focuses on a specific automation scenario, integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators.

## Tasks

1. **Automated Lighting System:** Uses an LDR to control LEDs based on ambient light conditions.
2. **Temperature-Activated Fan System:** Activates a fan when the temperature exceeds a threshold.
3. **Digital Combination Lock:** Unlocks an LED-based system with a specific button sequence.
4. **Sound-Activated Alarm System:** Activates an alarm when a loud sound is detected.
5. **Smart Plant Watering System:** Automates watering based on soil moisture levels.

## How to Run

1. Open the `.ino` file for the desired task in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the required components as per the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board or use tinkercad.com for simulations.
4. Test the system functionality.

## Circuit Diagrams

Each task folder contains the circuit diagram for the respective system.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each task is available in the respective folders.
